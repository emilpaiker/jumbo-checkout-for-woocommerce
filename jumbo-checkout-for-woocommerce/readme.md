## Jumbo Checkout for WooCommerce

This is a WordPress plug-in, that is also an extension for the plug-in WooCommerce.
It was created by Emil Paiker at FH Technikum Wien, as part of his bachelor thesis.

Jumbo Checkout for WooCommerce will be referred to as JCFW.

## Features

This plug-in adds a "Large Display" button to the WooCommerce checkout page.
Once a user clicks this button, a large and centered display appears in a pop-up like manner.
The field shows the first input field of the WooCommerce checkout page "First Name" as well as a "Next" button.
Once a user makes an entry and clicks the "Next" button, the next field of the WooCommerce checkout page is shown, and so on.
Thereby, a sequence of large checkout fields is shown to the user, as opposed to showing all of them at once.
This is supposed to help visually impaired, but not entirely blind people to use the WooCommerce checkout page.
The JCFW plug-in has been validated in theory for use by individuals suffering from the following visual impairments:

1. Cataract
2. Diabetic Retinopathy
3. Glaucoma
4. Macular Degeneration
5. Colorblindness
